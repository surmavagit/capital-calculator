# Capital Calculator
This is a toy project of mine that I started immediately after learning the basics of JavaScript (in the summer of 2022, before I joined GitHub).
The idea was to recreate the economic tables and formula, used by Marx in Capital - that is, to create an interactive version of them, which would enable the user to enter any numbers and the program would count the rest based on the input.

## First version: single Capital with 10 variables
[The first version of the calculator](https://github.com/surmavagit/capital-calculator/blob/main/legacy/singleCapitalTenVars.js) dealt with the formula `W = c + v + m`. It describes the total value of a commodity, produced by capitalist enterprise as the sum of constant capital and variable capital, embodied in the commodity, as well as the surplus value, added to it during production (see [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_capital)).



## Second version: Simplification and 


## Third version: Typescript and CLI
